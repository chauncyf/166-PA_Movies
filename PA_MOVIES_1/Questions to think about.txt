Describe an algorithm to predict the ranking that a user U would give to a movie M assuming the user hasn’t already ranked the movie in the dataset.
    Give tags to all movies, create a hash to store these tags,
    like{movie_1=>[“action”, “comedy”,]}. Create a tag hash of each user,
    store the rating of movies that watched by the user like {“comedy” => 5, “documentary” => 0}.
    A movie would have multiple tags,  compare these tags with user’s tags to predict the ranking.

Does your algorithms scale? You dont have to make it scale alot, I just want to see that you have an awareness of whether it does or does not, and why,
    Yes it’s scaled. At first, every time initialize the User object
    the program read the user.data file, this made my program run really slow .
    I fixed this by creating a hash list of object of all Users that only read the user.data file one time,
    this allowed my program to process all the data without a second.

What factors determine the execution time of your “most_similar” and “popularity_list
    I think is the process to create User objects of every user and store data into the User’s @movie_data variable
